## Forked Repository

This repository is forked from [PixiJS Devtools](https://github.com/bfanger/pixi-inspector)

## Usage

### PixiJS

In _your code_ find where the `PIXI.Application` instance is created, it looks like this:

```js
import { Application } from "pixi.js";

const app = new Application(...)
```

Expose that `app` to the **PixiJS Devtools** by adding the line:

```js
globalThis.__PIXI_APP__ = app;
```

or depending on your TypeScript and ESLint configuration:

```ts
(globalThis as any).__PIXI_APP__ = app; // eslint-disable-line
```

### Phaser

In _your code_ find where the `Phaser.Game` instance is created, it looks like this:

```js
import Phaser from "phaser";

const game = Phaser.Game(...)
```

Expose that `game` to the **PixiJS Devtools** by adding the line:

```js
globalThis.__PHASER_GAME__ = game;
```

## Custom setup?

If you don't use a `PIXI.Application` or `Phaser.Game`?
you can specify the root-node manually with:

```js
globalThis.__PIXI_STAGE__ = yourContainer;
```

And to enable highlighting and selecting the nodes in the viewport add:

```js
globalThis.__PIXI_RENDERER__ = yourRenderer;
```
