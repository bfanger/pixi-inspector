# pixi-devtools

The `__PIXI_INSPECTOR__` is constructed using the code in `pixi-panel/src/pixi-devtools/*`
These files can't use imports because they are eval'd in the context of the inspected page.

The connect.ts is continuously checking if a PIXI.Application or Phaser.Game is exposed a `__PIXI_APP__` or `__PHASER_APP__` respectively.
